<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>

<p> Jsonnet is a lazy, pure, functional, object-oriented, and domain-specific language.  Since it
has no side-effects, the JSON can be regenerated at any time, and since it is deterministic, this
will always result in the same output JSON.  Functional languages are ideal for refining and
processing structured data.  The object oriented features are ideal for deriving variants from
templates.  The combination of abstraction mechanisms from multiple paradigms makes the language
very good at keeping large amounts of JSON data under control, and extending JSON in the form of an
expression language provides good readability.</p>

<p>The syntax and semantics have been designed to be as conventional as possible to avoid surprises
and to ease the learning curve.  The language is also no larger than it needs to be, and conforms to
a written spec in order to allow multiple implementations to be written.  </p>

<p>The language is designed to be implementable via desugaring, i.e. there is a simple core language
and the other constructs are translated down to this core language before interpretation.  This
technique allows a language to have considerable expressive power, while remaining easy to
implement.
</p>

<h2>Rationale for Lazy Semantics</h2>

<p>The late binding from the object oriented semantics already embodies some of the features of a lazy
language.  Errors do not occur unless a field is actually dereferenced, and cyclic structures can be
created.  For example the following is valid even in an eager version of the language:</p>

<pre><code>local x = {a:"apple", b:y.b},
      y = {a:x.a, b:"banana"};
x
</code></pre>

<p> It would therefore be confusing if the following was not also valid, which leads us to lazy
semantics for arrays.  </p>

<pre><code>local x = ["apple", y[1]],
      y = [x[0], "banana"];
x
</code></pre>

<p> Therefore, for consistency, the whole language is lazy.  It does not harm the language to be
lazy:  Performance is not significantly affected, stack traces are still possible, and it doesn't
interfere with I/O (because there is no I/O).  There is also a precedent for laziness, e.g. in
Makefiles and the Nix expression language.</p>

<p> Arguably, laziness brings real benefits in terms of abstraction and modularity.  It
is possible to build infinite data-structures, and there is unrestricted beta expansion.  For
example, the following 2 snippets of code are only equivalent in a lazy language.  </p>

<pre><code>if x == 0 then 0 else if x &gt; 0 then 1 / x else -1/x
</code></pre>

<pre><code>local r = 1 / x;
if x == 0 then 0 else if x &gt; 0 then r else -r
</code></pre>


<h2>Modularity and Encapsulation</h2>

<p>In Jsonnet, a <dfn>module</dfn> is typically a Jsonnet file that defines an object whose fields
contain useful values, such as functions or objects that can specialized for a particular purpose
via extension.  Using an object at the top level of the module allows adding other fields later on,
without having to alter user code.  When writing such a module, it is advisable to expose only the
interface to the module, and not its implementation.  This is called encapsulation, and it allows
changing the implementation later, despite the module being imported by many other Jsonnet files.
</p>

<p>Jsonnet's primary feature for encapsulation is the <code>local</code> keyword.  This makes it
possible to define variables that are visible only to the module, and impossible to access from
outside.  The following is a simple example.  Other code can import util.jsonnet but will not be
able to see the <code>internal</code> object, and therefore not the function
<code>square</code>.</p>

<pre><code>// util.jsonnet
local internal = {
    square(x):: x*x,
};
{
    euclidianDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)::
        std.sqrt(internal.square(x2-x1) + internal.square(y2-y1)),
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to store <code>square</code> in a field, which exposes it to those importing
the module:</p>

<pre><code>// util2.jsonnet
{
    square(x):: x*x,
    euclidianDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2)::
        std.sqrt(self.square(x2-x1) + self.square(y2-y1)),
}
</code></pre>

<p>This allows users to redefine the square function, as shown in the very strange code below.  In
some cases, this is actually what you want and is very useful.  But it does make it harder to
maintain backwards compatability.  For example, if you later change the implementation of
euclidianDistance to inline the square call, then user code will behave differently.</p>

<pre><code>// myfile.jsonnet
local util2 = import "util2.jsonnet" { square(x):: x*x*x };
{
    crazy: util2.euclidianDistance(1,2,3,4)
}
</code></pre>

<p> In conclusion, Jsonnet allows you to either expose these details or hide them.  So choose
wisely, and know that everything you expose will potentially be used in ways that you didn't
expect.  Keep your interface as small as possible.</p>

<p>A common belief is that languages should make <code>local</code> the default state, with an
explicit construct to allow outside access.  This ensures that things are not accidentally (or
apathetically) exposed.  In the case of Jsonnet, backwards compatibility with JSON prohibits that
design since in JSON everything is a visible field.</p>
