<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p> There is currently one official implementation, written in C++11 with no dependencies.  It
provides a commandline tool to convert Jsonnet to JSON, and a C wrapper library to allow easy
binding into other languages.  A binding already exists for Python; the intention is that wrapper
libraries will soon exist for various other languages.  This enables any system that currently
consumes JSON to be altered to accept the full syntax of Jsonnet, by simply calling out to the
library to do the conversion.</p>

<p>The C++ implementation implements a handwritten lexer, recursive descent parser, static checker,
and virtual machine.  The virtual machine has a simple mark and sweep garbage collector.  The
release comes with a suite of over 500 tests for various corner cases of the language.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p> The C++ implementation of Jsonnet is currently available on <a
href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet">github</a>.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>There are a few limitations in the current release that will be fixed in future.</p>

<ul>
<li>Only ASCII is currently supported in strings.</li>
<li>Double precision floating point has rounding errors, we are considering switching to arbitrary
precision rational arithmetic.</li>
<li>The list and object comprehension syntax is not quite as expressive as Python's.</li>
<li>There is not yet any API to register handlers for import file I/O.</li>
<li>We would like to allow the importing of URLs, with an audit trail to allow debugging.</li>
<li>There is currently no tail-call optimization.</li>
</ul>
